Hardwired Control Unit.
uses gates, flipflops , decoders in hardware.
faster than the micro programmed unit.
Reduced intruction set computer example of this.

Advantages:-
1) Fast (control signals by using combinational circuit.
2)Performance is high.

Disadvantages:-
1) modifications very difficult 
2) difficult to correct mistakes of adding new features in existing system design of cu.  

Nano-Programming(or microprogramming).
.)The process of generating the microcode for the control memory is known as microprogramming.
.)Microinstruction Format.
.)The 20 bits of the microinstruction are divided into four functional parts.
a) F1,F2,F3:Microoperation fields.(3 bits each.)
b) CD:Condition for branching.(2 bits) (Selects status bit conditions)
c) BR:Branch Field.(2 bits) (Specifies the type of branch to be used)
d) AD:Address field.(7 bits) (AD contains a branch address. it is of 7 bits because control memory has 128 words.)

All transfer type microoperations symbols use five letters
first two letters represent teh source register, the third letter is always T , and the last two letters designate the destination register.

for example.:- DRTAC it stands for a transfer from DR to AC. 

BR Field consists of two bits and used in conjunction with address field AD, to choose the address of the next microinstruction.

Superscalar Processing:-
A superscalar implementation of a processor architecture is one in which common instructions - integer and floating-point arithmetic, loads, stores and conditional branches -  can be initiated simultaneously and executed independently.
